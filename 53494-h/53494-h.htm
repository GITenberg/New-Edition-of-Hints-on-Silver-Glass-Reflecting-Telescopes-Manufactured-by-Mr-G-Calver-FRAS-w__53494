Of the various forms of Telescopes now in use, each has its
own peculiar advantages; but the Silvered-Glass Reflector
is undoubtedly gaining favour among our practical
observers. A well-figured speculum, being perfectly free
from chromatic aberration, gives, in a proper condition of the
atmosphere, the finest possible definition of the Moon and planets,
the markings and colours of these objects being excellently seen;
while coloured stars, such as Albireo (β Cygni), or Almaach (γ Andromedæ),
are exceedingly well shown, the beautiful contrast of the
stars in the former being especially noticeable in a reflector. The
advice of “F.R.A.S.” (in the “English Mechanic,” March 21st, 1873)
as to the choice of a Telescope, may here appropriately be quoted.
After expressing a preference for refractors when measuring close
double-stars, he says, “But should the object of your correspondent
be merely to regard the wonders and beauties of the Heavens, or
notably, should he purpose to devote himself to the study of the
physical structure of the Moon and planets, then by all means let him
obtain the largest reflector he can afford; its absolute achromatism
tells most astonishingly on these last-named objects.” This is the
opinion of one who has great practical knowledge of the different
forms of Telescopes.</p>

<p>If Achromatic Telescopes of large aperture could be made as
cheaply as reflectors, and in as convenient a form, they would
doubtless be preferred for general star-work, although the aberrations,
especially that of colour, cannot be so perfectly corrected. A
silvered-glass reflector is, however, much cheaper than a refractor,
and, when the aperture exceeds five or six inches, is much handier to
work, and occupies less space, being only about half the length of
an achromatic of the same aperture. It is true that a reflector will
give less light than an achromatic of equal aperture&mdash;but this is, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
certain conditions of the atmosphere, a distinct advantage, the extra
aperture to give the same light adding to the definition and penetrating
power. An example of this is seen in the beautiful definition given
by an unsilvered mirror on brilliant objects, as the Sun, Moon, and
Venus. In large achromatics, the distressing excess of light has often
to be reduced by diminishing the aperture or using a higher power
than is convenient; and in such cases a lower and more suitable
power can be employed with a reflector.</p>

<p>When the air is unsteady, the definition of Reflectors, owing to
their tubes being open, is more liable to fluctuate than that of
refractors, although when a reflector does not give good definition
on account of the atmosphere, a refractor of the same aperture will
certainly not perform satisfactorily. Sir John Herschel has shown
that when the air in the tube of even an achromatic is disturbed
in turning from one object to another, good definition does not
return until it is brought to rest. In order to reduce the vibration of
the air in the open tube, and also that of the stand, to a minimum,
reflectors require to be very firmly and steadily mounted, and to have
iron tubes.</p>

<p>Many of the <ins class="correction" title="Original has speculas corrected by hand to specula">specula</ins> made by me are now in observatories,
where they have been compared with achromatics of first-rate quality
with the most satisfactory results. For instance, several 6-1/2 inch
specula were tried with two excellent achromatics of 4-1/2 and 6 inches
aperture, when the planetary definition was considered to be superior
with the reflectors; and the appearance of the star-discs, with equal
apertures, differed little from the beauty and hardness of the images
given by the achromatics. In viewing stars of great altitude, the use
of the refractor is extremely inconvenient to the observer, whose
position is necessarily very uncomfortable, while with the Newtonian
reflector any part of the heavens may be observed with the same ease
and comfort. In short, a good speculum, well mounted and situated,
is sure to be both pleasing and satisfactory.</p>

<p>It is perhaps unnecessary to remind the reader that, when the
defining powers of a telescope are put to the test, as much depends
on the acuteness of the observer’s eye and the practice he has had,
as upon the perfection of the instrument and the fineness of air. It
is a mistake to suppose that when the stars appear to be the brightest
to the unaided eye, definition will be at its best, though this may
happen; when it does so, the astronomer should make the most
possible use of the opportunity, as such nights are very scarce. As
a rule, the best nights are those when there is the slightest possible
mistiness of the atmosphere, and for the faintest stars absence of
bright moonlight. The 5 inch mirror is guaranteed to divide stars one
second apart with ease, and closer ones in very fine air. The 8-1/2 will
split such difficult pairs as γ<sup>2</sup> Andromedæ, and μ<sup>2</sup> Boötis. An acute eye
will master these stars with even a less aperture on very favourable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>occasions, γ<sup>2</sup> Andromedæ having been seen with a 7-inch stop of a
10-inch mirror, and Mr. Sadler, of Honiton Rectory, has split this
star with his 6-1/2-inch telescope. It sometimes happens on favourable
nights that the most difficult objects will be seen with the same
telescope, which on other occasions had failed to show them as well
as a much smaller aperture had done in very fine air. These remarks
equally apply to the observation of minute stars and planetary detail.
The amateur must follow the advice of the Rev. T. W. Webb, given
in “Celestial Objects” (pages 15-17), and must cultivate that virtue
applicable to all scientific investigation, namely, patience. The
following interesting and difficult objects may be looked for, the
powers used for their observation should vary from 150 to 300, and
for the very closest stars up to 500, or even still higher.</p>

<p>Since writing the first edition of my catalogue, the writer has
received many gratifying accounts of the success of the “Silvered-Glass
Reflector.” Many private letters have been received by him
from observers, expressing their delight and satisfaction. This has
been so encouraging that no pains have been spared, nor any opportunities
neglected, in turning to the best purpose every valuable
lesson that continued practice and experience may have suggested in
the manipulation of specula from time to time, in order to secure the
best means for obtaining the highest excellence of defining power.</p>

<p>Many modifications and improvements have been made in working
and testing mirrors, and special machinery and appliances constructed
for large sizes. But to complete my conditions suitable for
truly figuring and testing specula of considerable size, I found it
necessary to remove from the traffic and tremor of a town to a still
and tranquil situation in the country.</p>

<p>The truth of the curve is so sensibly and seriously affected by
vibration constantly going on in and near a town, that it is liable to
a variety of defects, and the surface becomes wavy and “plucked.”</p>

<p>As an instance, I may mention that my first and most convincing
proof of the advantage of the stiller situation was tested by an 18-inch
speculum (on which much labour had been bestowed); it was laid
aside, but successfully finished after removal, and without undulations
or any perceptible defect, and the Observer wrote me, that in
good air, he “saw Sirius as a brilliant white dot, without a ray or
appendage of any kind, and celestial photographs obtained with it
are very fine.” Such results were exceedingly gratifying, as they
were obtained with much less labour and uncertainly, and the
tedious process of the final touches had not to be repeated so many
times.</p>

<p>It is said that the celebrated Alvan Clarke, from the same effects
of tremor, never finished an object-glass to his satisfaction above-ground;
and Dr. Draper, testing his mirrors at the centre of curvature,
to avoid draughts, &amp;c. in an ordinary apartment, resorts to an
underground one.</p>

<p>In this little book of “Hints” it may be useful to remind those
who possess a speculum of fine quality that they are not produced
by a “rule of thumb”&mdash;so to speak&mdash;and that the difference between
<i>a</i> speculum and a really <i>fine</i> one, giving a maximum of defining and
illuminating power, is the result of considerable labour and thought,
and deserves careful usage.</p>

<p>The Rev. Cooper Key, an amateur of much experience, writes in
the “English Mechanic,” that he was eight months (working sometimes
eight hours a day), giving his 18 inch speculum its final touches
and corrections.</p>

<p>A well known correspondent of the “English Mechanic,”
“Hyperion,” tells us he found it impossible to test his 8-1/2 inch
mirror in an ordinary room, and had to resort to a tunnel under the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
clay of his garden. Those who have the means and perseverance
to make their own mirror, should be careful not to proceed with the
finishing touches until an hour at night when their workshop, if in a
town, is free from tremor.</p>

<p>First secure a well-ground and carefully-centred disc, let the polish
be as perfect as possible before any attempt is made to figure. Care
must be taken that every square or portion of the polisher is of the
same consistency and temperature, that the disc may not be acted on
irregularly.</p>

<p>To give the pitch this quality it must be well boiled and “pulled,”
so that no air bubbles are in the squares, as these cause expansion or
contraction as the temperature of the apartment varies, <ins class="correction" title="Original manually corrected on to or">or</ins> that of the
pitch and glass from friction.</p>

<p>It is much the best plan to keep the workshop to the same uniform
temperature as the polisher was made for, allowing no draughts to
pass over the mirror while working, nor the gas or lamp to be near.
When the polisher is warmed&mdash;which it should be after laying aside
for any time&mdash;it should be warmed <i>equally</i>. Neglect of the above
in making the polisher, or any incautious handling of either the disc
or polisher, will be sure to cause defects, which cannot be cured but
by retracing the early steps in the fine grinding with an accurately
centered tool.</p>

<p>The polishing successfully accomplished, the process of correcting
for parallel rays is next proceeded with. At every step all possible
care must be taken to prevent the mirror from running into an
irregular curve. The importance of this cannot be too strongly
urged, if a speculum capable of doing the <i>best</i> work is desired, as
the curve <i>must</i> be true, regular, or uniform, to give the <i>highest</i>
defining and illuminating power. An under-corrected mirror, if of a
regular curve, will perform much better than a compound correction,
exhibiting at the focal point much less lateral aberration.</p>

<p>A brief explanation of this may be of use as far as the limits of
these pages will admit. It would be impossible to teach, by a mere
description of methods, how to commence and finish off a speculum
of good quality, even if every working secret and minute detail were
unreservedly explained. The only way is to master sufficient theory,
and the rest will come by prolonged care and perseverance. I state
this because amateurs who have been desirous of enjoying the
gratification of observing with a mirror of their own making have
written for information which they have been quite willing even to
pay for liberally, but have felt disappointed, and perhaps thought it
somewhat discourteous, on being told that what they wanted was
impracticable and could not be satisfactorily attempted by the
Optician in writing. In some cases I have finished amateurs’ work
on agreeable terms, and which has led to a pleasant correspondence
or acquaintance. These remarks may prevent some future disappointment.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
Every one is familiar with the fact that the parabola is the only
concave surface that can reflect rays of light falling on its surface
from an object at an infinite distance&mdash;such as the stars and planets
practically are&mdash;to one common focus, or without aberration. This
series or column of rays (which is equal in diameter to the opening
of the speculum), reach the mirror without making an angle to it or
to each other, they travel side by side, they are all of one length,
and are reflected to a point, and are therefore all of the same
length at the proper focal distance, viz., half the radius of the curvature
of the concave. The properties of the parobola make the
nearest possible approach to it of the utmost importance.</p>

<p>It has been said that a considerably under-corrected surface, if of
a true and uniform curve, is better than one with less aberration, with
zones or sections of various curves. To explain this, let us suppose
an artificial star at some short distance, say 50 yards, the parabola
would not form an image of this at the eye-piece without aberration;
it has for this distance too short a focus for the central rays, and the
best disc is inclined to the inner focus, because the rays from the
object <i>diverge</i> towards it, instead of travelling parallel; and they
reach the surface (the central rays compared with the marginal), at
an angle equal to the semi-diameter of the mirror.</p>

<p>But, if instead of a parabolic mirror an elliptical one be used,
which has one of its foci at 50 yards’ distance, the image will be
perfect. Now place the artificial star at 500 yards, the image will
now be attended with perceptible aberration. The longer focus of
the ellipse must be worked further and further from the mirror by
shortening the focus of the central rays. Correct it for this distance,
and again remove the artificial star to a still greater distance, repeating
the corrections as before and carrying the outer focus towards
the object, and the inner towards the mirror, until the rays from the
object become more and more parallel, and the curve is nearer and
nearer to the parabola, or that eccentricity of ellipse which acts
better and better for distant objects or parallel rays.</p>

<p>It is evident from this that if the ellipse is corrected very considerably
towards the parabola, without irregularities, and <i>every part</i> of
the surface corrected regularly from the centre to the edge (no part
hastening more than another), that such a surface, though under-corrected,
is much better than if one portion is fully and another
under-corrected, especially if the more imperfect portion is towards
the edge. Such a compound correction may show little or no <i>outstanding</i>
aberration at the focal point, but the rays do not find a focus
at the same regular pace as they would from a regular curve&mdash;one
edge of a zone will be coming into focus when another would be
going out. With the focussing screw they are focussed to the place
where they appear to collapse, and are most satisfactory, though, <i>in
reality</i>, the rays at the best place bend over each other, and the
definition is imperfect. From a star, which is only a point, this may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
be more tolerated, but on the planets, where the image has a sensible
diameter, and is perhaps magnified many times, this imperfect curve
is very inferior to the regular one, whose error is all of <i>one kind</i>. The
light is all there <i>somewhere</i>, but not with any good effect. There is no
<i>proper</i> illumination or definition, as rays are employed which are
crossing the optical axis at <i>varying</i> angles, and the result is confusion.</p>

<p>So the amateur who sets himself the pleasant task of making his
own speculum (for there are many who can better afford the labour
than the capital to purchase, and whose capabilities are thus superior
to their means), need not be discouraged and give up the pursuit
because he cannot obtain the best results by getting a perfectly parabolic
glass. But if he has been successful in removing a considerable
amount of the spherical error, and advanced to the elongated ellipse
by maintaining a truthful curve, “let well alone” with this disc, and
proceed no further, but commence <i>another</i>, taking care not to alter
the first until the second is <i>better</i>, and <i>then</i> an improvement of the
first may be attempted.</p>

<p>In the second attempt, should the amateur lose control over the
<i>regularity</i> of the surface, let him try it as an experiment against the
first on the planets, and he will not fail to appreciate the difference,
and will be stimulated by fresh courage to get as near to the parabola
as possible with the same accurate curve.</p>

<p>To produce a true and uniform curve is, however, the acme of
troubles, whether it is desired to obtain the spherical, or parabola,
or any other curve. It is generally supposed that the spherical curve
is a very easy matter, so easy indeed that it is difficult to avoid.
This is a very great mistake&mdash;a spherical curve of undeviating truth
is as difficult a problem as a true parabola. The spherical curve is
the <i>only uniform</i> curve, it has but <i>one</i> focus, and the polisher must
coincide with, and be of the same radius as the glass, at every instant.
This is why the optician strives to obtain a semi-polish with the
grinder to lessen the risk of losing his curve on the polisher, for the
curves of an object glass are spherical. The curve most liable to be
obtained by the amateur is the spheroidal, a curve with its marginal
rays <i>shorter</i> than the central, or half the radius of curvature.</p>

<p>There are no means with the <i>telescope</i> of telling the spheroidal,
approximating to the sphere, <i>from</i> the sphere. There are <i>no</i> means
of analyzing the exact character of a curve <i>equal</i> to certain methods
at the centre of the curvature, but to accomplish this requires much
practice and observation, with “surroundings” perfectly free from
vibration. If the amateur can overcome this, and lives in or very
near a town, he should only work at the polishing and figuring
during the late hours of the night, when traffic, &amp;c. have subsided.
Then, by carefully preventing any draughts in the apartment, and
with the mirror of the same temperature as the air in the room, he
will then be able to see how varied and numerous are the chances of
error in working a mirror, and the great care necessary to avoid or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
cure them. He will find the surface exceedingly prone to receive
zones and irregularities during work, and much more so than to
“work true.”</p>

<p>The necessity for avoiding incautious handling or heating may be
realized by the following little experiment when one can manage and
understand it:&mdash;Place the tip of one finger on the surface, as it
hangs in the dark room ready for testing, and with very gentle
pressure let it remain long enough to spell one’s name; it will then
be seen that the feeble heat of the finger has, by expansion, raised a
mound on the surface of the glass, and though this amount of swelling
must be <i>very</i> small, yet it is enough to cast a shadow across the
surface, as if something were laid on it, and quite ten minutes will
elapse before the heat will leave this spot and the surface again
become level. Now if the polisher were placed on the glass while
this hillock was there, a permanent hollow would be the result. For
a full account of these methods (of which Foucault was the discoverer)
the reader is referred to Sir John Herschel’s and Dr. Draper’s
works on the telescope.</p>

<p>Care must be taken not to leave too much aberration, as then the
central disc is formed too positively outside the focus, and the rest of
the light from the object appears as obtrusive rings and false light.
The over-correction is bad, and acting as a negative lens the disc is
formed too near the mirror. Such a correction, besides being objectionable
on almost all classes of objects, prevents the use of the
“Barlow” lens, and acts badly with all kinds of positive or Ramsden
eye-pieces, which improve <i>under</i>-corrected, but “make bad worse”
with over-corrected surfaces.</p>

<p>If these few and brief hints should stimulate the industrious and
persevering student to make his own telescope, and thus enjoy the
fruits of his own labours (which may add a relish and a pleasure to
his astronomical work), they will have served the purpose for which
they are written.</p>

<p>After a “Hint” on the choice of focus for the mirror, it only
remains to say a few words about the plane, as this, with the large
speculum, are the only parts that need be home-made as far as the
optical work is concerned. Never adopt a “dumpy” for general
use where high powers are sometimes wanted, for small and moderate
sizes, say 8 to 12 diameters, and for large sizes not less than about 6
diameters of the mirror, as the larger ones practically admit of a
shorter focus. The short ones can be mounted somewhat cheaper,
but never choose them on <i>this</i> account, they will not make so satisfactory
an instrument, and no adaptation of “Barlow’s” will make
it so.</p>

<p>To make the plane, provide three well-turned metal discs of 7 inches
or 9 inches diameter. Iron is the best, as the work will go down closer,
and the plates or discs may be very thick&mdash;say an inch&mdash;and not so
liable to “spring.” These turned discs must be scraped and ground<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
perfectly flat on each other, until they are in good contact all over,
so that there is nothing between the faces when testing them. In
the earlier stage of “truing,” oil and colour can be used. When these
discs are proved true, a disc of plate glass, same size, is cemented
with pitch on one of them, or on a thick disc of glass, and care must
be taken that it is not strained while on the block during working.
Truly grind this plate on one of the tools to a fine semi-polish.
Polish on the same tool with a piece of thick silk or alpaca, laid over
and cemented down by a solution of resin dissolved in turpentine
(as much resin as the turpentine will dissolve), then, with the tip of
the finger, thinly smear over the tool and bind round the edge with
cord, and the silk will keep in place. Fill up the texture of the silk
or alpaca evenly with damp rouge, keep it uniformly damp, and never
let the rouge and water work about. It may be polished on very
hard strained pitch, but pitch for the amateur is not so safe, as it is
liable in his hands to alter its form and destroy the truth of the plane,
but it is the quickest and handiest if it can be managed.</p>

<p>After the polish is <i>perfect</i> remove the plate from the support and
cut into squares a little larger than the size of the intended flat. Test
these in the telescope on a <i>star</i>. If one plane turns out bad, the
whole will most likely be so, and another plate must be worked with
renewed energy and care, for a bad plane will spoil the action of the
speculum however good, for there is no way of counteracting the
curved surface of the flat or second reflector. The edge of the
plate for about an inch should not be used.</p>

<p>When a good plane is found it can be edged by turning a piece of
wood a little less in diameter than the minor axis of the plane required,
turn the end square, and mark a line around it distant from the end
equal to the diameter, and cut through to the opposite edge, and it will
give the oval and will appear round at 45°, this will mount nicely in
brass tubes of the proper size, and a cover should be made to fit
easy.</p>


<p class="sub-heading">“THE EQUATORIAL.”</p>

<p>Fig. 1 is a modification of the German principle, and it should be
a sufficient recommendation to remark that it is the principle used by
a maker of such experience as Mr. John Browning, and is, without
doubt, the very best style of mounting for a fixed equatorial, especially
when clockwork is employed, because clock power is applied to the
polar axis itself direct from the driving worm.</p>

<p>The driving part, viz., the worm and wheel, which is out of the
observer’s way (being between the standards), is not liable to meet
with accident, and the driving wheel being near the lower end of the
axis, is at the most rigid part, viz., the foundation of the instrument.
As it has a long and very firm polar axis, and is connected with the
foundation plate, it secures the utmost steadiness and freedom from
strain.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
An equatorial mounting, with two long and stiff shafts for the axes,
has always the advantage of firmness; the <i>holding</i> portions of the
instrument being in masses, are not liable to receive injury from
blows, and thus be put radically out of order. <i>No means should be
resorted to to make an equatorial of light weight</i>; an instrument cannot
be light and slim and at the same time <i>firm</i> and <i>steady</i>&mdash;no amount
of steadying rods, splines or strings, will make a slender tripod for a
refractor so steady as a firmly made one, with proper size and weight
in the parts.</p>

<p>Another important advantage of this kind of mount for a large
size is, that although it has considerable weight, it is very convenient
to move and set up, being built of convenient parts, which are easy
of separation and removal. The uprights or standards are separate,
and are bolted to the bed-plate, the upper and lower discs are readily
detached from the stand. The cradle and tube are in this construction
separable. The tube of the telescope being suspended over the
<i>side</i> of the stand, is in the most convenient position for observing
objects at any altitude, as the stand is out of the way and clear of
the telescope. The various disadvantages and objections to the
driving clock being <i>carried</i> by the telescope are here avoided. The
clock, which is large and very powerful, is bolted down to the iron
bed-plate, and the telescope, not having to carry the clock or weight,
the balance is never altered nor the rate of the clock disturbed, and
thus a strong clock, keeping regular time, and working much longer
can be used. They will drive 2-1/2 hours. It will be readily
understood that a driving clock to enable the instrument to do
the most exact and best work must be powerful and a good time-keeper.
Lord Lindsay has said that “the clock should have twice
as much power as is <i>used</i>,” otherwise the spindles, &amp;c. are pent up,
and it is moreover sensible to any extra weight or work being put
upon the instrument.</p>

<p>To give an idea of the efficiency and regularity of this clock, I
may mention that a Newtonian telescope of 18 inches aperture,
intended to carry a photographic camera of 112 lbs. weight, needed
no additional provisions to do the extra work, the rate and power not
being affected. There is a mechanism in the clock “for making up
of time” and in setting the hour circle can be used with a joint
handle or hooks as a fine screw-motion, and can be applied whether
the clock is going or not. There is also a provision at the foundation
for throwing the instrument out of the meridian, to follow the
motion of the moon or planets with the clock and “maker up.”
The above mounting is equally suitable for “Cassegrains” and
“Newtonians,” to both of which forms it has been successfully
applied up to 18 inches of aperture. It is well suited for large
telescopes.</p>

<p>Fig. 2 is a mounting on the same principle, but with a shorter
polar axis, and the column is in one casting.  It is well suited for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
moderate sizes, and the circles, &amp;c. are applied exactly as in Fig. 1,
but when a clock is wanted there is no mounting equal to the former.</p>

<p>The “Educational” is a plain 6-1/2 inch, of 4 to 6 feet focus, and is
made to this pattern, with revolving body and screw-motion for
following. It is made as portable as it can be, and is a steady, good-working
instrument, and much approved of.</p>


<p class="sub-heading">THE UNIVERSAL ALT-AZIMUTH.</p>

<p class="center">(<span class="smcap">Fig. 3.</span>)</p>

<p>In this mounting I have seen little or no alteration needful, except
that the tube is now made to balance so that the eye-tube can be
reached for objects in the zenith without the observer having to
elevate himself, and the elevating rod can be clamped without the
lever, the legs of the stand are more curved and have more spread in
them.</p>

<p>This “Alt-Azimuth” stand has met with much approval; and where
portability is of consideration and the observer has to set up and
remove the entire instrument after every night’s work, this, or the
Angle-Block stand, will be found the most convenient, more so
than an equatorial in any form. There is much less weight to remove,
and being in three convenient parts is more readily put together and
separated in the dark. If the stand and trunnions can be left in the
open air a very small covering will serve to protect them, and then the
tube alone has to be removed. The equatorial cannot be too highly
recommended where it can be a fixture and undisturbed, as when
once got into proper adjustments its advantages can then be realised,
but not unless it is a permanent fixture. The circles of a portable
equatorial can only be used for very rough reading, and consequently
the adjustments are never in order, and the readings are of very
limited use indeed.</p>


<p class="sub-heading">THE IMPROVED “ANGLE-BLOCK” STAND.</p>

<p class="center">(<span class="smcap">Fig. 4.</span>)</p>

<p>With respect to the tube, it is mounted like the Alt-Azimuth, but
with the plane of the horizontal movement corresponding to the
latitude of the place of observation, and therefore following objects
with one screw movement is in reality a telescope with equatorial
motions. It need not be of heavier construction than the Alt-Azimuth,
and there is not the double weight of counterpoising, &amp;c.
as in the equatorial, and when circles are not desired this will be
the most economical, handiest, and easily managed instrument, as it
partakes of the equatorial form or motions. The telescope tube is
well balanced, and the declination movement is easy and free, and
fitted with a clamp screw, so that when the instrument is turned on
an object that object can then be followed by an endless screw.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
It can be made to suit any latitude, and by the addition of foot
screws on a level floor, can be got into suitable adjustments, and if it
has to be removed (for the stand is very little heavier than an
ordinary Alt-Azimuth), “guides” can be provided, so that it can go
very approximately into the exact place again when brought out for
use. They are made, when desired, with a revolving body and fine
screw-motion in declination.</p>


<p class="sub-heading">THE “POPULAR REFLECTOR.”</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">With Angle-Block Stand.</span>&mdash;(<span class="smcap">Fig. 4.</span>)</p>

<p>The speculum is 5-1/4 inch diameter, and carefully figured, and is
recommended as a very useful instrument. The size and power of
this telescope has been adopted as that most likely to meet the
means and requirements of a large number of amateurs. Many
prefer to commence astronomical observations with “<i>something
inexpensive</i>,” and are led to begin with the popular and well
advertised 3 inch refractor at £5. These, except in a few chance
cases, are sure to prove disappointing, and are perhaps the cause of
their giving up any further attempts to follow up the subject of
astronomy, which may otherwise be so pleasantly and profitably
pursued with a reliable instrument.</p>

<p>It is well known that a less aperture than 4-1/2 inches is insufficient
to give the observer a satisfactory idea of the varied and most
interesting details of the planets, and the ever-changing outline and
tone of the belts and markings of Jupiter, Saturn, and Mars. Large
apertures bring out <i>details</i> when the smaller ones can only show a
<i>general outline</i>. The former also delineates more with a lower power,
providing the focus is of proper length.</p>

<p>The planets and nebulæ cannot be seen to advantage without
aperture and focal length. The field of view is then flat, the object is
properly illuminated, with sharp and crisp definition, and is also <i>much</i>
less subject to annoyance from tremour, through the necessity for
constant adjustments in the fields, &amp;c., as is the case with small
apertures, for the object is magnified more in proportion. A certain
magnifying power is necessary in order that the object may be sufficiently
large to scrutinize; and this, whether the aperture is large or
small, must be from about 150 to about 300 times for the planets.
But 150 on a 3 inch is a high power for the quantity of light obtained,
to say nothing of the separate consideration and advantage of long
focus. Aperture is a quality or function of the telescope considered
separately from light or focus. For instance, suppose a 5 inch
speculum is so thinly silvered that it gives the exact degree of light
as a 2-1/2 inch refractor, the defining and separating power of the 5 inch
aperture would be very superior to the 2-1/2 inch.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
The “Popular Reflector,” with 5-1/4 inch speculum of 5, 5-1/2, to 6 feet
focus, will be found very suitable, and if its illuminating power is not
greater than a 4-1/2 inch refractor, its defining and dividing powers are
superior. By choosing the above focal lengths, according to circumstances,
the observer can reach the eye-tube, while standing erect for
objects in the zenith, and it is a great mistake to suppose that the
shorter the tube the more handy it becomes. These foci will not require
a “Barlow” lens to flatten the field. The “Barlow” is very useful
for short foci when the aperture is considerable, as it improves the
imperfect correction for spherical error, but this is much better
corrected in the mirror itself than by a “Barlow” lens, which cannot be
used without more than one disadvantage. There must, by its
insertion, be some loss of light, which can ill be spared with small
instruments, and when used to obtain magnifying power there is
some disturbance of colour, and this subtracts from the beauty and
purity of the definition of a reflector. There is <i>nothing</i> equal to a
good eye-piece to obtain <i>power</i>, and <i>flatness</i> of field by the <i>curve</i>
of the speculum.</p>

<p>With the “Popular Reflector” and an outlay of a few shillings on
some popular books, such as the excellent work “Celestial Objects,”
by the Rev. T. W. Webb, and some first-class publications by
Mr. R. A. Proctor, especially his smaller star atlas, &amp;c., the amateur
can compare the work he is then capable of doing with a large and
expensive refractor which might be beyond his reach.</p>


<p class="sub-heading">THE ADJUSTMENTS OF THE EQUATORIAL.</p>

<p>When the inexperienced amateur purchases an equatorial with
circles, he should not be without the third edition of “Chamber’s
Handbook of Descriptive Astronomy,” which, besides being an
excellent book in other respects, is a really practical guide to the use
and application of the Equatorial, and is indispensable to the
beginner. He will there find the fullest details of the adjustments to
any degree of exactness. Besides many other matters he will be
instructed in the use and application of apparatus to the perfect
Equatorial, including all kinds of eye-pieces, micrometers, &amp;c., &amp;c.,
as well as other optical instruments and accessories.</p>

<p>The Equatorials described in this catalogue are provided with
every means of adjustment. The cradle contains powerful screws
to set the line of sight at right angles to the declination axis, and
shifting screws to place the polar axis in the meridian and to the
correct elevation, and with care and a few experiments with the
adjustments, and by observations of some catalogue stars, the various
adjustments will soon be correctly made, and the verniers set
accordingly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span></p>

<p class="sub-heading">THE CASSEGRAIN.</p>

<p>This is a form of reflecting telescope but little known. This is
rather strange, since it is a very much better principle than the
“Gregorian,” so well known to the old observers. Herschel says it
admits of a theoretically perfect telescope. Compared with the
“Newtonian” it has its advantages and disadvantages. Its principal
advantages are, first, the shortening of the tube, which in large
telescopes is sometimes very important. Secondly, the observer has
not to <i>ascend</i> to the eye-tube, the observations being made at the
lower end, as with a refractor. The “Cassegrain” has a flatter field
of view, owing to the action of the curve of the second reflector
causing the rays to travel twice the distance, and, adding the element
of magnifying power, the eye-pieces need not be composed of small
lenses. The adjustments are perhaps a little more trouble, as the
line of collimation must be carefully attended to, this requiring only
a little more care can soon be accomplished, and then the definition
of a good “Cassegrain” is very pleasing.</p>

<p>Amongst its disadvantages is the necessity for the observer to gaze
upwards as with refractors, which, when the object is at a considerable
altitude, is distressing, this is one of the reasons why the
“Newtonian” is so pleasant to use, on account of the natural and
easy position of the observer. The eye-piece being a fixture, it is
not quite so convenient to use some of the accessories of the
telescope. But there are means to overcome these drawbacks, and
so make the “Cassegrain” even more handy than the “Newtonian.”</p>

<p>I have mounted an 18 inch speculum of 12 feet focus in the
“Cassegrain” form, so that objects at any altitude could be observed
with the greatest possible ease. A plane was fixed near the large
mirror to receive the rays from the convex reflector and to throw
them out to the side, illuminating apparatus were fixed here, and
micrometers, &amp;c. used, as if it were a “Newtonian”; the tube was
thus made shorter, and the flat field of a long focus realised, but
there would be a little loss of light in consequence of an extra
reflection, but this, with a large aperture (and the fact that the
“Cassegrain” gives a little more light than the “Newtonian”) can
better be spared, considering the convenience gained. The observer
is not elevated for any altitudes, and a large telescope is actually
occupying less room than a small one. It can be used with or without
the diagonal.</p>

<p>I have, by request, fitted the “Cassegrain” with means for two
observers to view the same object at the same time. A perforated
plane was arranged to receive a portion of the converging rays and
throw them to the side of the tube into an eye-tube, and the
remainder passing on to the eye-tube at the proper place, two images
are thus formed, and can be magnified at will and viewed simultaneously.
The perforated plate was so arranged that it could be
removed at pleasure.</p>

<p class="sub-heading-bold">THE ALT-AZIMUTH STAND.</p>

<p class="center">Fig. 3.</p>

<p>The Telescope, being balanced on trunnions, can be moved from
an elevation approaching the zenith to an almost horizontal position.
In order that it may be secured anywhere between these extremes,
attached to the upper part of the telescope is an iron rod, which,
sliding through the end of the arm of the stand, can be there clamped.
The telescope will now be clamped in <i>Altitude</i>. As the progression
of celestial objects will apparently be very slow, resource must be
had to the smoothness of motion obtained by a screw. The upper
end of the Altitude rod is therefore tapped to receive a long screw
with a large milled head, jointed to the telescope body; by revolving
this head the telescope is raised or depressed accordingly as the
screw is unscrewed, or the reverse. It is necessary that the screw
should be withdrawn some way from the rod before clamping it,
preparatory to following an object which has passed the meridian, or
is setting; as perhaps, just when the clearest vision is obtained, the
observer may be annoyed by the screw action being suddenly stopped
by the milled head coming in contact with the top of the rod.</p>

<p>When viewing objects near the zenith, and the focus long, the
handle attached to the clamp will be found useful, as it can thereby
be reached without leaving the finder. The handle may be so placed
that a downward push should clamp, and an upward pull release.</p>

<p>The second motion in the Alt-azimuth Stand, namely, <i>Azimuth</i>, is
obtained as follows:&mdash;The strong iron disc which forms the upper
fitting of the legs has its surface accurately turned. On this revolves
an iron disc, rather less in diameter, to which the trunnions which
support the telescope are attached. The main axis of this disc
passes through the centre of the lower disc, and then through a hollow
bearing tube, a continuation of it. All these fittings having been
most carefully turned and ground together, great steadiness, combined
with facility of horizontal movement, is ensured. In order that this
motion can be communicated as evenly as possible, resource must be
again had to a screw which is thus applied. Just within the circumference
of the lower disc is a narrow groove, turned to such a depth
that the ring which is thus separated from the main disc is still firmly
held to it by the uncut portion. An iron clamp grooved to this ring
holds the nut of a long screw, the plain end of which is jointed to
the upper disc. When this clamp is fixed to the ring, any motion
given to the screw will act on the upper disc, and cause it to revolve,
and thus the whole telescope will be slowly moved in <i>Azimuth</i>. The
advantages of this plan are many, the most important being the
rapidity and ease with which the telescope can be shifted from one
object to another, even to those in contrary directions; all that is
necessary being to release the clamp and turn the telescope to the
object required. The clamp being carried round with the upper disc,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
can be fixed directly the desired position is obtained, when the screw
is at once in action. Should it happen, whilst following an object, that
the screw becomes exhausted from the joint and clamp coming together,
the clamp should be released, and the screw turned sufficiently in
the reverse way to bring it into action, the weight on the upper disc
keeping the telescope meanwhile in position. If this operation be
rapidly performed, the whole length of screw can be brought in
play before the object has left the field of view of the finder, and
can thus be easily refound with the higher power of the telescope.
Motion is applied to the screw by means of a Hook’s joint, named
thus from its inventor. This joint being furnished with a long
handle, enables the observer, by means of it, to move the Telescope
in <i>Azimuth</i> at any rate, and without removing his eye from the
eye-piece.</p>

<p>It will be seen from the preceding remarks that by means of the
vertical and horizontal screw motions, the telescope, when clamped,
can be moved in any direction with the greatest facility, permitting a
celestial object to be observed with high powers for a considerable
time, and with the greatest pleasure and comfort to the observer.</p>

<span class="smcap larger">Adjustments.</span></h2>


<p>These instruments are always sent out in correct adjustment, and
with moderate care during transit, and afterwards, will remain so, but
as the performance of the instrument greatly depends on the accuracy
of the adjustments the following instructions will enable the observer
not only to ascertain whether they are perfect, but also to render
them so if found defective. These adjustments are by no means
difficult, and will be easily understood by attention to the following
remarks:&mdash;</p>

<p>Into the draw tube screw the “adjusting piece,” which is a small
brass circle with a hole in its centre about 1/20 of an inch in diameter.
(The draw tube should be in about the same position as when at
focus with an eyepiece.) Place the large mirror in its cell in the
tube or body of the telescope, taking care that the three bayonet-joint
pins are correctly placed, that is, with grooves pointing downward.
They will be found to drop easily into their corresponding
holes; care must however be taken that the grooves have gone well
home. Both the speculum and small mirror, or “flat,” must be uncovered.
On looking through the aperture of the adjusting piece, if
the mirrors are in correct adjustment their reflections will be seen as
follows:&mdash;the small oval mirror being placed at an angle of 45° will
appear circular, and reflected exactly in the centre of this circle will
be seen the bright image of the large mirror with a dark round
spot in its centre, as shown by Fig. 1. This dark spot is the double
reflection of the “flat,” and should be concentric with both the bright
reflection of the large mirror and the circular outline of the “flat.”
All these should also be perfectly concentric with the circle given by
the stop in the draw tube. Should these circles not be all central the
adjustments are not perfect and must be rectified as follows.</p>


<p class="sub-heading-bold">To adjust the “Flat” or small diagonal Mirror.</p>

<p>If the bright reflection of the large mirror is seen as a perfect
circle, but not exactly in the centre of the “flat,” the latter requires
adjustment; for this purpose loosen the milled head screw at the
middle of the back of the “flat” which in large instruments is made
sufficiently heavy to act as a counterpoise to prevent vibration. This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
will allow the “flat” to be rotated by the hand vertically with respect
to the tube of the telescope. Bring the bright circular reflection of
the mirror exactly central in this direction, and fasten in position by
screwing up the milled head screw or counterpoise. If the circular
reflection is quite central no further adjustment is required, but if not,
then, after completing the vertical adjustment, as described, proceed
to make the horizontal adjustment by turning in one or other direction
the milled head of the horizontal adjustment screw, situated in front
of the vertical adjustment screw; this will bring the circle of light
exactly into its proper horizontal and central position, and the adjustments
are then completed.</p>

<p>If the bright reflection of the large mirror is <i>not</i> seen as a perfect
circle, and the small dark spot not in the centre, the speculum is out
of adjustment, and consequently the adjustment of the “flat” is best
performed by removing the large mirror or speculum with its cell and
so arranging the body of the telescope that on looking through the
“adjusting piece” a large sheet of white paper spread on the ground
a short distance from the open end appears as a white circle of light
reflected in the “flat.” Now bring this white circle exactly into the
centre of the flat precisely in the way described above, and on this
being accomplished replace the speculum uncovered with its cell, and
proceed<ins class="correction" title="original missing full stop">.</ins></p>

<p>When in perfect adjustment the large mirror viewed through the
“adjusting piece” should appear as before stated, as a complete
bright circle, with the image of the “flat” as a smaller dark circular spot
exactly in the centre (Fig. 1). Should this not be the case it must be
rectified by means of the three adjusting screws at the back of the cell.
Proceed as follows:&mdash;First unloose (by a few turns) the small clamping
screws which pass through the larger hollow adjusting ones; then, on
looking through the adjusting piece the relative position of the image
of the “flat” should be carefully noted.  If the dark spot is nearer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
the bottom, and consequently more of the top part of the bright
circle is seen (Fig. 2), the mirror reflects too much of the upper
part of the tube, and therefore the top of the mirror leans too far
back and must be pushed more forward by screwing in the top
adjusting screw (<i>a</i> Fig. 1) a little at a time till the dark spot is central.
Should the spot be towards the top (Fig. 2 <i>inverted</i>), the reverse holds
good and the top adjusting screw (<i>a</i>) must be <i>un</i>screwed or the two
other adjusting screws turned in. Should the spot be towards the
left (Fig. 3), screw up the right adjusting screw (<i>c</i> Fig. 1). If towards
the right (Fig. 4), screw up the left adjusting screw (<i>b</i> Fig. 1). The
dark spot is always furthest away from that part of the tube which is
too much reflected, and from the adjusting screw that must be turned
in to correct it.</p>

<p>When all the adjustments are considered perfect, as in Fig. 1, the
small screws are to be clamped up to keep the adjusting screws in
position. If, after the greatest care has been taken in adjustment,
a flare should appear on looking at a star (say of the second magnitude)
with an eye-piece of a high power, and the diffraction rings are
not quite concentric, it can generally be rectified by turning the large
screws of the mirror round in cell a little at a time. If this does not
remove the flare the adjustment of the “flat”. is not sufficiently correct
and must be altered by means of the screws at its back. If the
flare is at the top or bottom of the star the “flat” must be very slightly
revolved by the hand, after unloosing the middle screw, and when
correct reclamping it. If at either side, namely, in the direction of the
major axis of the “flat” and in a line with the tube, the “flat” must
be altered by the long screw. It is always advisable to leave the telescope
for a short time undisturbed, especially if, on first looking at a
star, a flare should appear, as these appendages often vanish when
the instrument has been for a short time in the air. These adjustments
may at first appear somewhat difficult, but are rendered remarkably
easy by observing how the different screw movements alter the
positions of the reflections. A useful test as to the correctness of the
adjustments may be obtained by viewing a star with a high power
eye-piece out of focus. When in the centre of the field it should
appear as a bright luminous circle with a circular dark spot in the
centre, the size of the bright circle diminishing as the focus is
approached and the dark spot remaining central.</p>

<p>The cell mount of the large mirror can be removed from the tube
and replaced without disturbing its adjustments, but it is very advantageous
if the entire instrument can always be left undisturbed when
not in use in an observatory of light construction, having a skeleton
revolving dome, covered with well oiled canvas or calico, and made
with a wide opening and large shutters. The Rev. E. L. Berthon
has described in the “English Mechanic,” October 13th, 1871, an
observatory of this kind most admirably suited to shelter a reflector,
as the temperature inside would be as nearly as possible that of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
external air, and no annoyance from damp would be experienced.
Where an observatory is not practicable the telescope might be protected
by a close fitting covering of like make. Both the large and
small mirrors should be protected by their covers (with which they
are provided), when not in use, especially if left in the open air. The
larger sized tubes have a door large enough to admit the cover and
so allow of its being put on the large mirror without the necessity of
the speculum being removed from the body of the telescope.</p>


<p class="sub-heading-bold">To Adjust the “Finder.”</p>

<p>Direct the telescope to any bright star (the Pole-star being by far
the best, as it has very little apparent motion), and bring this star into
the centre of the field of a low-power eye-piece. Now adjust the
“finder” by means of the three screws bearing on it, till the star is
bisected by the cross wires seen in the focus of the eye-lens of the
“finder.” Change the low eye-piece to a high one, and perfect the
adjustment as before described. Any well-defined terrestrial object
at a distance can be employed in the day-time to roughly adjust the
“finder,” leaving the final adjustments to be made by a star.</p>


<p class="sub-heading-bold">The use of Stops.</p>

<p>A stop 1/4 inch less in diameter than the speculum, is often useful,
in order to cut off the internal reflections of the tube.</p>

<p>With mirrors 6-1/2 inches in diameter and under stops are seldom
required; with the 6-1/2 inch a 5 inch stop may however sometimes be
used with advantage on very bright objects. With an 8-1/2 inch mirror
a 7 inch stop often improves planetary definition.</p>

<p>With larger sizes than 8-1/2 inches several stops of different diameter
may be used, when experiment will determine what size is best suited
to the condition of the atmosphere, and the character and brilliancy
of the object to be observed. These stops can be easily cut out of
thin cardboard and afterwards blacked with Indian-ink or lampblack.</p>


<p class="sub-heading-bold">On Observing the Sun.</p>

<p>No larger aperture than 4-1/2 inches should be employed for solar
observation, except with a specially constructed “Solar Eye-piece,”
as even a 4-1/2 inch speculum often concentrates sufficient heat to crack
the coloured glass of an ordinary sun-cap, if exposed for any length
of time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
If a “solar eye-piece” is employed, the whole aperture may be
used. In viewing the moon a slightly tinted glass is often most useful,
especially to persons with weak sight, as it takes off a great deal
of the glare.</p>


<p class="ph2"><span class="smcap">To Silver and Polish the Specula.</span></p>

<p>The cost of silvering is trifling, and with cleanliness and ordinary
care very little difficulty will be experienced. The apparatus and
chemicals required consist of the following articles:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Apparatus.</span>&mdash;A Silvering Vessel:&mdash;This should be a flat-bottomed
circular glass or glazed dish, 1 inch or more larger in diameter than
the speculum to be silvered, and sufficiently deep to allow of a stratum
of fluid of an inch or rather more between the face of the mirror and
the bottom of the dish, the top of the mirror being nearly level with
the edge of the dish.</p>

<p>A Mixing Vessel:&mdash;A 40 oz. glass measure will answer well, but
care should be taken not to scratch the sides whilst stirring, or the
glass is liable to fly. Should a measure not be procurable, any receptacle
of sufficient size may be used, but a glass one is best, as it
will allow of the action of ammonia being better observed.</p>

<p class="item">A Box of Scales and Weights.</p>
<p class="item">A Glass funnel and filtering paper.</p>
<p class="item">Two Glass Rods for Stirring purposes.</p>
<p class="item">A Five-ounce Glass Measure.</p>
<p class="item">A Test tube 3/4 or 1 inch in diameter.</p>
<p class="item">Some Clean Cotton Wool.</p>
<p class="item">Some very fine Wash-leather.</p>
<p class="item">A Support of Wood, on which to cement the speculum, described further on.</p>

<p>All these articles should be perfectly clean and free from dust, and
the Glass ones well rinsed with distilled water just before using.</p>

<p class="itemtop"><span class="smcap">Chemicals.</span>&mdash;Nitrate Silver.</p>
<p class="item">Potash pure, precipitated by Alcohol.</p>
<p class="item">Sugar of milk powdered.</p>
<p class="item">Nitric Acid, pure.</p>
<p class="item">Liquor Ammoniæ.</p>
<p class="item">Distilled water, pure.</p>
<p class="item">Pitch.</p>
<p class="item">Fine Rouge.</p>
<p class="item">Turpentine.</p>

<p>Procure a strip of wood an inch or so less in diameter than the
mirror, and of sufficient length to rest securely on the opposite sides<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
of the silvering vessel. Pour on this piece of wood some melted
pitch, and whilst it is still hot, place on it the back of the speculum
moistened with a little turpentine; when cold, reverse, and lay the
cemented speculum face downwards, suspended in the dish. Should
the distance between the face of the mirror and the bottom of the
dish be less than an inch, raise the mirror by means of thin wedges,
placed between the strip of wood and the edges of the dish. But if,
on the contrary, the mirror should be considerably more than an inch
away from the bottom, which will occur if the silvering vessel is very
deep, the speculum must be cemented to a block of wood of sufficient
height, screwed to the suspending strip, instead of being
cemented directly to the strip itself.</p>

<p>When the speculum is properly placed in the dish, namely, with
the front surface about one inch from the bottom, pour in water till
the fluid reaches about 1/4 inch up the side of the mirror. Measure
this quantity, as it will indicate the total amount of the silvering solution
required to be prepared.</p>

<p>To prepare the Silvering Solutions&mdash;make 3 standard solutions as
follows&mdash;</p>

<table summary="To prepare the Silvering Solutions">

</table>


<p>Solution No. 3 must be made just before using. The others will
keep if the distilled water employed in their preparation is pure, and
the solutions, when made, are kept <ins class="correction" title="Typo original kept is glass">in</ins> glass stoppered bottles.</p>

<p>Suppose it is desired to silver an 8-1/2 inch mirror, proceed as follows:&mdash;the
total amount of solution required having been ascertained, as
before described, pour 2 ozs. of solution No. 1 into the mixing vessel
previously well washed and rinsed with distilled water, and cautiously
add Liquor Ammoniæ. A grey precipitate will be formed; continue
to add the ammonia, drop by drop, till the precipitate is just dissolved
and the solution becomes clear. The solution should be well stirred
with a glass rod whilst adding the ammonia. Now add 4 oz. of solution
No. 2, and re-dissolve the brown precipitate which is produced
with Liquor Ammoniæ as before described. There will now be about
6-1/2 oz. of solution. Subtract the 6-1/2 oz. from the total amount previously
ascertained to be required, and the remainder will be the
amount of distilled water to be added. Add half this quantity of
distilled water to the 6-1/2 oz. of solution, and add a drop at a time of
solution No. 1, till there is a slight precipitate, which cannot be re-dissolved
by a considerable amount of stirring (say for 2 or 3 minutes);
then add the remaining half of distilled water and cover up from dust
the vessel containing the solution, so as to allow the slight precipitate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
to settle. There is a point of importance to be attended to, namely,
that no more ammonia is employed than is absolutely necessary.
The total amount of ammonia required in the 6-1/2 oz. of solution is
about 2 drs.</p>


<p class="sub-heading-bold">To Clean the Mirror.</p>

<p>Fill the end of a test tube with cotton wool, leaving plenty outside
the tube. Having poured a small quantity of strong nitric acid
on the front of the mirror, rub the acid well all over the front and sides
with the cotton wool brush. Place the speculum under a water tap
for a few minutes till the acid is washed away, and finally well rinse
with distilled water; then place it in the silvering vessel (previously
thoroughly cleansed) and pour in distilled water till it reaches 1/8 inch
up the side of the speculum.</p>


<p class="sub-heading-bold">To Mix the Solutions.</p>

<p>The precipitate having settled, pour into a clean vessel all that is
clear of the solution, leaving about 2 oz. behind, which will be turbid
with the precipitate, and therefore useless. The total amount will
be afterwards made correct by the addition of the same quantity of
solution No. 3. Having filtered solution No. 3, warm it to about
100° F. by allowing the bottle to stand in warm water, or by heating
in a small flask. When everything is quite ready, add 2 oz. of the
filtered solution No. 3, whilst warm, to the clear solution described
above, and thoroughly mix.</p>


<p class="sub-heading-bold">To immerse the Mirror.</p>

<p>Remove the mirror from the distilled water, taking care not to
touch the surface of the mirror, and wipe the back and edge with some
clean cotton wool. If this precaution is not taken the water is liable to
drain down the sides of the mirror whilst silvering, and cause streaks
at the edge of the film. Having poured away the distilled water in
the silvering vessel, substitute the mixed solutions, and directly the
solution becomes slightly inky, gently immerse the mirror, taking care
that no air bubbles, or specks of any kind, remain between the surface
of the mirror and the solution. The mirror should not be removed
from the bath until all the silver has been exhausted from the
solution. This may be known by the solution being clear below the
silver film on the surface of the liquid. The time required will vary
from 45 minutes on a hot summer’s day, to 90 minutes when the
thermometer shows a low degree of temperature. In the latter case
it is better to have the silvering bath in a warm room.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
Immediately the mirror is removed from the bath, the silvered surface
should be well washed by allowing ordinary water to flow on it
from a tap, for five minutes or more, then finally rinse with distilled
water and place the mirror to dry with the silvered surface resting on
some blotting paper. It is as well if the mirror can be left
undisturbed for a day or two, as the film will be firmer, but it may
be polished, if desired, after drying for a few hours.</p>


<p class="sub-heading-bold">To Polish the Silvered Surface.</p>

<p>Make a couple of polishing pads by filling two pieces of very soft
wash-leather about six inches square loosely with cotton wool, and
tie them into balls. Gently remove any dust that may have
settled on the film with some loose cotton wool, and then go over it
with one of the pads in small circular strokes for about 15 minutes.
This will consolidate the film and fit it for polishing. Spread
a little of the finest rouge on a sheet of writing paper, and impregnate
the other pad with it. Go over the film with the rouged rubber
with the same circular strokes till it is perfectly polished, which will
take another 15 minutes or so. Never commence with the rouged
pad, as the surface may be injured. When once the film has been
consolidated it will remain so, and can be repolished many times with
the rouged pad should it get tarnished. The pads should be kept
from dust in wide-mouthed bottles for future use. With care the film
will last for a long time, especially if it is not allowed to get damp,
and consequently the mirrors should never be brought uncovered
from the cold air to a warmer temperature.</p>

<p>The “flat” may be silvered and polished in the same way as the
speculum, using a smaller appropriate vessel for the silvering solution.</p>


<p class="sub-heading-bold">To Separate the mirror from the Wooden Support.</p>

<p>Should the mirror be attached directly to its support, insert a chisel
between them, when one or two gentle blows will cause them to
separate, but, should the mirror be cemented to a block, stand
the mirror on edge, when a slight tap on the block will detach
it. Scrape off any pitch that remains on the back of the mirror,
using finally some turpentine to wipe it clean. Great care should be
taken not to finger the film.</p>


<p class="sub-heading-bold">Martin’s process for Silvering.</p>


<p class="p1">Prepare four solutions of any quantity. Keep in stoppered bottles.</p>

it on the moon, the definition of minute craters was all that could be desired. I

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;I have mounted the 5-inch speculum on a simple equatorial and it
works well. I am sure it will turn out a fine glass and I shall not regret the time
and pains I have spent over it. It is not quite in adjustment yet, when it is it will
afford me a treat. I have just tried it once on the Orion Nebula and Trapezium,
details of Nebula well seen, and the 5th star in Trapezium easy.</p>

divides the test objects and shows delta Cygni with as low a power as 160. The
comes to Sirius may be considered an atmospheric test, perhaps, but I have repeatedly
seen it. Your stand I find very steady and convenient; altogether I can
fairly say that I consider that I have an instrument of considerable power at a
comparatively small cost. I now find the attempt to observe with a refractor the
reverse of pleasant.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>γ<sup>2</sup> Andromedæ are well divided.  The 6th star in the trapezium stands out well
clear of its brighter neighbour. On the moon any power may be applied, only
lessening the light, but retaining sharpness of outline. I have tried a good many
telescopes, but never yet saw these 10-inch mirrors surpassed. The image of a
star disc expanded on each side of the focus is of as nearly the same appearance

<p class="drop-cap">
The object of this pamphlet is to give some new and additional
advice not contained in my “Hints on Silvered Glass Reflecting
Telescopes,” on silvering and adjusting them; and, as the
results of continued and recent experience, it is hoped they may be
useful, and may prove an acceptable appendix to my little book of Hints.</p>

<p>The first thing to do after fastening the mirror to the wooden support,
is to suspend it in the dish in which it is to be silvered, and so to adjust
it that there shall be one inch between the bottom of the mirror and the
bottom of the dish; then pour in water to come a quarter of an inch up
the sides of the glass&mdash;the quantity thus found is to be measured, and
will be the exact amount of the bath when all the solutions are mixed;
this will prevent any hitch at an important moment, and the glass can
be immersed without delay or disturbance.</p>

<p>Next proceed to wash the surface with nitric acid, taking care that the
acid does not run down the sides, as it is not so easily removed from the
fine ground sides as it is from the polished surface. After gently but
thoroughly rubbing the surface, add a little water, and again go over;
then wash all off, and take a large piece of cotton wool and well sponge
the surface and sides with plenty of water, and suspend in a dish or plate
with water in it.</p>

<p class="p2 center">TO PREPARE THE SOLUTIONS.</p>


<p class="p1">The plan I adopt is this,&mdash;I dissolve a large quantity of the chemicals
required in one-fourth or one-eighth the quantity of water employed by
Martin, so that in a Winchester quart stoppered bottle I can keep a large
supply ready. I make the silver and ammonia solutions eight times the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Appendix_2" id="Appendix_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
original strength, the potash and sugar solutions four times only, as these
latter solutions require more water to properly prepare them.</p>

<p>Enough solutions to silver a 6-1/2 in. mirror, eight times are to be made.</p>

<p>Dissolve 1400 grains of nitrate of silver in 10 ounces of water (it
may be clean fresh rain water filtered, if distilled is difficult to obtain,
and it will act very well), but do not put the silver into the exact 10
ounces, but make up to exact 10 ounces after the silver is dissolved. It
is thus condensed eight times. Do the same with the nitrate of ammonia,
by dissolving 2096 grains.</p>

<p>Next prepare the potash and sugar solutions, condensed to four times
the initial strength.</p>

<p>Dissolve 8 ounces of potash, and make up to exactly 20 ounces of
water; if this is dissolved in a glass measure it will evolve sufficient heat
to break it; it is safely done in a clean white jug. Lastly, dissolve
4 ounces of white sugar candy with 416 grains of tartaric acid, and boil
ten minutes in a clean glazed vessel; when cold, add 8 ounces of alcohol,
and make up to 20 ounces with water.</p>

<p>Do not use the solutions till all are of the same temperature, nor on
the same day as they are made; and do not silver until the glass, and
<i>everything</i> used are of the same temperature. To insure this, get the
mirror ready and suspend in water, with the solutions all collected in the
room in which the silvering is to be done, and let them remain until
next day.</p>

<p>Now, remembering how many ounces were needed to leave one inch of
solution under the surface and a quarter of an inch up the sides of the
6-1/2 in. mirror, using a vessel about 2 inches larger in diameter than the
mirror, pour into a glass measure 10 drams of the silver solution, add
next 10 drams of the ammonia, then 20 drams of potash; if the potash
turns the mixture thick, pour it backwards and forwards into another
vessel, or stir it with a strip of glass, or a glass rod, for half a minute;
if the mixture does not turn clear (which it will not do if it has turned
very thick on adding the potash), add cautiously, drop by drop, some of
the ammonia solution, agitating it till it just clears; do not filter unless
there are a great many floating particles through using unfiltered water,
the floating particles cause minute black spots, which are, however, of
little consequence, as their action is only the loss of so much light.
Measure 20 drams of the sugar&mdash;and the mirror being ready to dip (the
amount with the sugar added must be the required quantity previously
ascertained), add the sugar, stir well, and immerse when the mixture
begins to turn dark ink colour.</p>

<p>When silvered, well wash the mirror with water of the <i>same</i> temperature<span class="pagenum"><a name="Appendix_3" id="Appendix_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
as itself (it may be safely sponged with a lump of cotton wool),
and stand it on its edge on blotting-paper to dry. Drops of water
standing long on it when drying will cause stains, which will not readily
polish off, and indeed these should not be polished, as it is not right to
polish one part more than another; so it is best to leave them, or if this
is objected to, re-silver the mirror, when standing it in the sun and wind
will soon dry the surface, but be careful not to let the dust settle on it.</p>

<p>Do not warm anything; if the weather is cold, everything may be left
many hours in a warm room, but the <i>equal</i> temperature is of the utmost
importance&mdash;the actual temperature is not of much consequence. More
failures are due to unequal temperature than any other cause in the
hands of the amateur. One careful and clever amateur informed me
that he had failed six times, but on the seventh, by attending to the
advice given above, the silvering was a perfect success, and all seemed
then as easy and certain as it had before seemed uncertain and difficult.</p>


<p class="p2 center">THE FINAL ADJUSTMENT OF A
NEWTONIAN REFLECTOR ON A STAR.</p>

<p class="p1">The adjustments being as near correctness as can be seen by the usual
method of procedure&mdash;of which the fullest details are given in my little
book, the telescope is ready to try on a star. If all does not appear
satisfactory on first observing the star, do not disturb the adjustments
for a while, but wait until the air is steadier, when perhaps it will be
quite satisfactory. If not, turn it on a bright star; if the adjustments
are at fault, the black shadow of the flat, when the star is out of focus,
will not be central in the slightly expanded image, but will be on one
side of the expanded disk. Use a power of 200 to 300.</p>

<p>If the black spot is near one of the sides corresponding with major
axis of flat, the side screw will put it right. We will assume that the
black spot is nearer the edge of flat nearest the mirror, and that the eyepiece
is beyond the focus proper for the star; then <i>unscrew</i> the side
screw. If the spot is nearer the other edge of flat, <i>screw it up</i> little by
little, taking the hand out of the telescope each time, and see what the
effect is. The movement and alteration can be watched while the hand is
in the tube. If the spot is seen either the top or bottom of the flat that
is in the direction of the diameter of tube, the middle screw must be
slightly loosened and the flat revolved. Let the screw just bite so as to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Appendix_4" id="Appendix_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
hold, and tighten it when correct. The definition of a star should now
be perfect, and by daylight observe the adjustments; it may appear that
the reflected circles are not concentric, but if the definition on a star is
good in still air, consider the appearances correct adjustments, except
that the reflection of the black spot on mirror may be made concentric.
It sometimes happens that a persistent and rigid centreing of the
reflections on <i>face of flat</i> are not the positions for best definition, perhaps
from a slight optical eccentricity somewhere in the instrument.</p>

<p>The adjustments of a reflector are soon familiar and easy, and there is
this to be said, the adjustments can be manipulated upon to any amount
without the slightest injury to the instrument; there is no danger of
any sort, and the instrument can be perfected in its adjustments by daylight,
and this makes it both pleasant and convenient to leisurely work
at, for experience sake. The instrument need not be out of doors either,
unless an artificial star from a black pin’s head&mdash;which is better in
<i>strong</i> sunlight than a thermometer bulb&mdash;is to be used instead of a star
at night, if so let it be as high as possible.</p>

<p>Be careful not to screw up the small screws too tight, as the fine
threads are liable to be spoiled and the screw made useless.</p>


<p class="p2 center">THE DURABILITY OF SILVER FILMS.</p>

<p class="p1">It sometimes happens that the films do not last so long as they are
expected to do, that is, they sometimes lose their splendid lustre sooner
than they should do. When it is remembered that though the process
of silvering is an easy operation to perform, yet it is a delicate chemical
one, in which good results are best obtained when several good conditions
all meet together, this is not to be wondered at, but it is certain
the instructions given above will reduce the chances of failure to a
minimum, and imperfect results will be rare. The silver usually lasts a
long time. I know silver films that have been in use for ten years.</p>

<p>Do not suppose that a long and badly worn surface will fail to
show the detail and colours of the planets, the fullest detail also of
the moon or the stars. It is surprising how long a silvered surface will
continue to do its full work while its appearance is much deteriorated;
picking up faint points of light that are near the very limit of its
aperture and power, seem alone to require the perfect and fresh film. I

That the Silvered Glass Reflecting Telescope is giving satisfaction and
is capable of performing the best work of a telescope&mdash;being durable,
convenient, and perfectly efficient&mdash;may be gathered from the selection
of a very large number of satisfactory and most gratifying letters
received by the writer; and it has been most encouraging to find in all
cases the observer is most eager to express his entire satisfaction, and
especially so where so many have been prejudiced, in the absence of
experience, with feelings of doubt as to their <i>complete</i> efficiency, and
many, again, having used fine refractors.</p>

<p>It will be seen, too, that many have commenced with a small sized
reflector, and gone on increasing their optical power until they have
obtained a large and powerful instrument, imposing indeed as compared
with what was considered a powerful instrument less than half a century
ago, and at a fraction of its cost.</p>

<p>The gratifying success which I have achieved, attested by the universal
satisfaction given by the instruments supplied by me, is the result of unwearying
labour and untiring patience; every speculum, large or small,
being figured with my own hands.</p>

<p>I have every facility for setting up instruments, and for testing,
working, and regulating them in every part on celestial objects. The
optical parts are, therefore, not merely tested separately and subsequently
mechanically adjusted, but each and every instrument is put together and
optically and mechanically tested, as a whole, before it is permitted to
leave the workshop.</p>

<p>Every speculum is most carefully figured, and confidently guaranteed
perfect <i>to the extreme edge</i>.</p>

<p>The employment of “stops” of any kind is quite unnecessary, except
on bad nights, when the aperture must of course be suited to the degree
of steadiness of the air. For, whether the instrument be a reflector or a
refractor, the aperture and power used must of necessity be limited by
the atmospheric conditions under which observations are made.</p>

<p>It should, however, be remembered that the reflector having not only
a much larger aperture than a refractor of same focal length, and, being
open to the influence of the external air, is not only affected by a relatively
larger column of air, but is affected in a different way. It
frequently happens that reflectors of 6 in. to 18 in. aperture, are of same
focal length as 5 or 6 inch refractors.</p>

<p>These considerations will explain the occasional use of stops, and the
expediency of having them ready to use when they can be of temporary
advantage. There are nights in our climate when a 6 inch aperture may
be the largest that can be used with satisfaction or advantage; indeed it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Appendix_6" id="Appendix_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
used to be accepted as an incontrovertible fact that an aperture of
G inches was the largest that could be used on <i>average</i> nights in our
country. But there are also not a few nights when large apertures, bring
great gain to their fortunate possessors.</p>

<p>It is obvious that, <i>mutatis mutandis</i>, these conditions must affect
refractors as well as reflectors, with perhaps this difference, that in the
case of a reflector the rays pass down the tube and infringe on the
speculum as a column of parallel rays; consequently all the external rays
of the column travel near the surface of the tube for its entire length.
This being so, it is obvious that until the internal and external air and
the metal tube have time to equalize in temperature, it will be advantageous,
in all work requiring high powers, such as the examination of
difficult double stars, to “stop off” for a time the <i>extreme edge</i> by a
small diaphragm.</p>

<p>This will occur especially on frosty nights after a warm fine day.
When the telescope is in the open air, ice will not infrequently form on the
top of the tube, and the effect will be at once obvious in the irregularity
of a star image at the edge corresponding to the top of the tube. The
use of a small diaphragm will at once obviate this defect and give perfect
images. On such nights a wooden tube is preferable to a metal one. It
has been frequently my experience, when finally testing an instrument,
that when I have been dissatisfied with its performance, and in order to
trace the cause of the apparent defect, have removed the mirrors to my
wooden testing tube, I have found every defect removed, and imperfect
replaced by perfect images. The explanation is simple. Not only is the
wooden tube much larger in diameter than the specula, but wood is of
itself less sensible than metal to differences of temperature.</p>

<p>To make the tubes some 2 or 3 inches larger in diameter than the
speculum would cure this evil, but it would involve various inconveniences
and expenses in structure, which would more than outweigh the advantage
of overcoming a hindrance which is after all only temporary and
occasional.</p>

<p>The experiment of perforating or ventilating tubes has now been
thoroughly and exhaustively tried, with the result that there is a fairly
general consensus of experienced opinion against their use. The advantages
are merely theoretical; the disadvantages are grave. Among them
are the admission of cross reflections in every direction, the admission of
dust, imperfect protection of the mirrors, and a decided loss of strength
and rigidity to the tube.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Appendix_7" id="Appendix_7">[Pg 7]</a></span></p>

  AND THEIR ACCESSORIES,</h2>

  <p class="center">OCTOBER, 1880.</p>
</div>

<p class="p2">G. Calver, while introducing the list of prices below, has the greatest
confidence in calling the attention of the practical astronomer and the
amateur to the very moderate prices charged, considering the principle
and style of the mounting, and the firm and well-fitted arrangements in
all the parts.</p>

<p>The principle of the mounting is that which is the most convenient
to use, and with the greatest degree of steadiness with the easiest
movements. Fig. 1 is the <i>best mounting ever applied to the Reflecting
Telescope</i>.</p>

<p>He is also able to state that, with his processes and special facilities
for working large specula, and substantially mounting them, he is prepared
to construct automatic equatorials of large  sizes, and with any
special arrangements that may be required.</p>

<p>Fig. 1 is a very excellent mounting, and admirably suited for large
instruments, especially when clock-power is applied; and as now manufactured
by <span class="smcap">G. Calver</span>, is the most complete and reliable, its details of
construction being such as to give the greatest freedom of motion and
steadiness. For large sizes the top of polar  axis works  on  friction
rollers; and, as a superior German stand, its arrangements and means of
astronomical as well as optical adjustments, are such as to make it an
instrument of precision.</p>

<p>To ensure these qualities many well considered arrangements—entailing
careful and expensive workmanship—must be provided; details that do
not easily admit of description in an ordinary catalogue, or can be shown<span class="pagenum"><a name="Appendix_8" id="Appendix_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
in an engraving, but are duly appreciated by the observer, who will find
their value by practice.</p>

<p>The cradle bar is compound with fine screw movement for perfecting
collimation, but to make this adjustment perfect, the telescope tube must
be centred in a powerful lathe, and the cradle and solid metal rings in
which the tube revolves (<a href="#Appendix_36">see illustration</a>) has to be turned and fitted
with true flanges or working bearings; the mechanical and optical
centres will then coincide.</p>

<p>The hour circle, to be truly divided, must be truly made, and is a solid
wheel of good substance, working on a secondary axis, and rotated by
mechanical means, truly concentric, with a very strong polar axis.</p>

<p>The declination circle has fine tangent screw movement, with double
action for setting the readings by milled-headed screw, and also long
driving rod from the eye-piece to set and adjust the object in centre of
field. There is slow hand motion, by a separate wheel in right ascension.</p>

<p>The clock-power is connected and disconnected instantly, by touching
with the finger a small lever, conveniently placed at a small door in the
clock case. The clock will go at exactly the same rate, whether it is
driving the telescope or not, and the latter begins to move at the proper
speed the instant the lever is moved, and the connection of the telescope
and clock made, which is instantly effected by another lever.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;I have mounted the 5 inch speculum on a simple equatorial, and
it works well. I am sure it will turn out a fine glass, and I shall not regret the
time and pains I have spent over it. It is not quite in adjustment yet, when it
is it will afford me a treat. I have just tried it once on the Orion Nebula and
Trapezium, details of Nebula well seen, and the 5th star in Trapezium easy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;With reference to your enquiry as to the performance of the 6-1/2
inch reflector, I have pleasure in stating that I am perfectly satisfied. It
readily divides the test objects, and shows delta Cygni with as low a power as
160. The comes to Sirius may be considered an atmospheric test, perhaps, but
I have repeatedly seen it. Your stand I find very steady and convenient;
altogether I can fairly say that I consider that I have an instrument of considerable
power at a comparatively small cost. I now find the attempt to
observe with a refractor the reverse of pleasant.</p>

<p>The owner of a 3 inch refractor, after using my reflector, writes that he
envies me its power, ease, definition, and comfort in observing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;I have much pleasure in informing you that the very first
time I saw Saturn through your 6-1/2 inch reflector, the definition of the planet
was far superior to anything I had observed before, even with a good 4-1/4 inch
refractor; and on another occasion I was greatly pleased with the clear and
easy view of the “Comes” to ε Boötis. But even without including the stars,
the views of Saturn and Jupiter through my 6-1/2 inch mirror do <i>alone</i> (in my
opinion) well repay the cost of the telescope.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;You have asked me for my opinion of the 10 inch speculum.
I have tested it, and can speak in the highest terms of its performance. Definition
in good air is as near perfection as it is possible to imagine. Such tests
as ζ Cancri, γ<sup>2</sup> Andromedæ are well divided. The 6th star in the Trapezium
stands out well clear of its brighter neighbour. On the moon any power may
be applied, only lessening the light, but retaining sharpness of outline. I have
tried a good many telescopes, but never yet saw these 10 inch mirrors surpassed.
The image of a star disc expanded on each side of the focus is of as nearly the
same appearance as possible.</p>

my 8-1/2 inch to this object, the air was very unsteady, in fact not nearly so good

a 6-1/2 inch stop, which I found very much increased the steadiness of definition.</p>

In middling good air, when I could use a reduced aperture with satisfactory
results, the star images reminded me of the 6-1/2 inch, which I considered so
superb a mirror that nothing could surpass its fine performance either on stars
or planets.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;As to the adjustments of the 8-1/2 in., I have had very little
trouble, and I have tried it again on a few objects, a few nights ago, and with
a 7 in. stop, and a power of 300, I split Zeta Cancri and the close double <i>sf</i>
Castor; with the full aperture they were very easy. I have also split Gamma
Andromedæ with 7 in. stop, and on a very fine night. I believe 6-1/2 in. would
do it.</p>

<p>I just got a look, on November 7th, at the shadow of Titan, on Saturn’s disc;
but was driven inside before I could observe the time of its passing the centre.
I have seen the Moon on two occasions with the finest definition I ever saw.
Altogether I am highly pleased and proud of my telescope. I have not yet
tried many faint objects; still I saw the Crab nebula in Taurus much nearer
Lord Rosse’s drawings than Herschel’s, as given by Chambers.</p>

aperture shows itself. I have no doubt I picked up the outer Satellite, but
cannot be certain till to-night, if I am permitted to see it. The only objection
I have is its short focus, as it seriously complicates my labours in matching the

duties, I have been obliged to postpone it from day to day. I have been
working steadily, however, with your 18″, and I like it the more I use it. The
figure is wonderfully perfect, and the definition of planetary details and
markings most admirable.</p>

<p>On four occasions I have seen the Satellites of Mars; of these I can feel quite
certain of two, for it was held sufficiently long to perceive a marked change in
position angle. The intensely small companion to <i>a</i><sup>2</sup> Capricorni I have well
seen, cleanly separated, and that in strong daylight. I am anxious for a good
night to attack τ Orionis. During these observations I have been using the
telescope as a Newtonion during my work at the convexes; but my labours have
been pleasantly intercepted by the magnificent and gorgeous views of the star
clusters and nebulæ&mdash;more beautiful and startling than I could possibly have
imagined, and surpassing far anything I had ever pictured to my mind.</p>

<p class="dated"><i>December 10th, 1878</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;The 5-1/4 in. is beautiful. Last night there was a slight frosty
fog, and the air was very very steady, in fact I only remember about one such
night since November, 1875. Saturn was sharp and hard, and the shadow of
the ring intensely black, with all powers from 168 to 372, and even with 550,
obtained by removing the field lens of 372. The very broad polar caps presented
a bluish grey, rendered more visible by contrast with a fine penumbral line of a
very slightly brownish grey close to the south border of the ring, and which
seemed to be diffused on the south border (<i>i.e.</i>, the line was diffused). I should
fancy the line here referred to was less than 1″ of arc broad; considerably less!</p>

<p>Turning from Saturn, I looked at ε Arietis, the present distance of which is
only 1″·17; with all powers, from 213 upwards, the components were visible as
two tiny points of light thoroughly divorced, and with 288 power, reminding
one of ε<sup>2</sup> Lyræ, as seen with 120 on a 2-3/4 in. achr., only the discs seemed freer
from rings.</p>

<p>Later in the evening, when the definition was more fluttery, η Orionis shared
the same fate as ε Arietis, being well separated with the same powers. The
present distance of this star is only 1″·12. Recently I divided this star with a
4-1/2 in. stop on the mirror, power 288. I have seen ε Arietis well with the same
stop too. I think I have told you before that the 5-1/4 in., with 372 power, was
successful in dividing ε Equulei, whose distance is only 0″·97. This is the
closest star I have yet divided.</p>

<p>The Moon is fine too! Last night I caught a large ring close to the terminator,
near the south pole (for the Moon was only about 2-1/2 hours past full), which was
looked at over the northern wall; the view was beautiful, such gradations of
light and shade, interspersed with greys of different hues, which render the
object scarcely describable. The finest clefts and tiniest craterlets are rendered
visible. It is a puzzle to me how anyone in the possession of £16 or £17 can
go buying a refractor of from 2-1/2 to 3-1/4 in. aperture in preference to a silvered
mirror. It must be from sheer ignorance of the beautiful views given by the
latter, which is superior in every way.</p>

<p>I do not think there is any other point on which I need touch now, so I must
beg to remain,</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;I was very much interested in reading your account of the
grinding and polishing of the 37″ speculum, in this week’s E. M., copied from
the “Monthly Notices” of the R. A. S. Had I only the wealth of my
neighbours, I would give you an order for the largest telescope you
could construct. Every really good night gives me some fresh proof of the
great excellence of the 6-1/2 in. For instance, on December 15th, I clearly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Appendix_21" id="Appendix_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
and steadily saw <i>Enceladus</i>. I could not, of course, have recognized it had
it not been that this month’s “Observatory” gave diagrams of the positions
of the five inner sats. of Saturn, for 8 p.m. on every day of this month, and a
careful search for Encel. was fully rewarded by a clear and steady view of it at
that time in its proper place. On this feat the Rev. <span class="smcap">T. W. Webb</span> warmly congratulated
me, and said that he had seen Encel. with his 9-1/3″ “With,” but
only when Saturn was hidden behind a bar. I saw it clearly in exactly its
proper position <i>without</i> hiding the planet&mdash;power 400. I have also had several
good views of Mr. <span class="smcap">Webb’s</span> new nebula in Cygnus, and have sent him drawings
of the field, which he confirms. I have also made some fine drawings of Jupiter
and Mars. On December 12th, 11 p.m., I tackled σ 749 (in Taurus), a very
difficult test for my aperture, only 0·8″, and <i>perfectly</i> split it with power 300.
The night was superb. When you consider that the theoretical limit of
dividing power for a 6-1/2″ is only 0·7″, I think I have done well to split a star
0·8″ in our climate.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;I write to tell you that Thursday night being very fine, I had
a good opportunity of trying the (an 8-1/2″) mirror on Jupiter, although this planet
was lower than it should have been to give the fairest trial. Well, I can only
assure you that, despite the low position, I never saw it so beautifully before.
The contour of the clouds, particularly one orange one, <i>sf</i>, the delicate lines,
and the colouring of the belts, were all seen with a sharpness which I had
believed scarcely attainable, and proving that the result of your labours has
been to effect a very real improvement in the speculum. Notwithstanding the
good planetary definition, the air was not tranquil enough for seriously
attacking really difficult doubles; still I was much pleased with its performance

<p>Yours of July 25th duly to hand. I have the speculum adjusted in the
“pink” of accuracy. Star discs are small and round, with concentric diffraction
rings, and quite rayless except in the case of the very brightest stars, and
even with these the rays are very trifling. But for the diffraction rings,
which I fancy a really good night will mostly get rid of, I should, I feel sure,
have readily divided η Coronæ.</p>

<p>The Moon last night, though very low, was seen with most gratifying ease
and sharpness. Altogether you will gather that I am more than satisfied. I
am greatly gratified, and will look forward to great pleasure as the season advances.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;You have indeed surpassed yourself, and your performance
is better than your promise. The mirror arrived safely yesterday, and when I
unpacked it I was exceedingly pleased with its surface and general appearance,
but of course that was a small matter. I waited till night to test it on a
close double.</p>

<p>I first tried it on ε Boötis, and although the night was very bad the
definition it gave of the two stars with 450 and full aperture was admirable,
considering the night. After waiting a long time for clouds to clear away, I
turned the tube on that exceedingly difficult test, δ Cygni. I consider this star
to be one of the severest tests for any telescope, reflector, or refractor of any
aperture in the whole heavens. The performance of the mirror upon it, with the
<i>full</i> aperture, was simply <span class="smcap">MAGNIFICENT</span>, the small close companion standing out
clearly, well separated from its bright primary, although the night was not
good. I hardly thought it possible that the fine 18 inch mirror could be
excelled. I am bound to confess that you have excelled it.</p>

<p>To say that I am extremely grateful to you is a very poor expression of my
feelings. I am pleased and delighted <i>beyond measure</i> with the <i>super-excellent</i>
18-1/4 in. mirror you have sent me. Clouds put an end to my work last night,
but I have no doubt that in the future every night’s observations will only
accumulate proofs of the exquisite perfection of your handiwork.</p>

<p class="from"><i>Extract from the “English Mechanic,” September 3rd, 1880</i>.</p>

<p>“The telescope is a silvered-glass Newtonian reflector. There are two
specula, one of 18 in. in diameter, figured by the celebrated <span class="smcap">With</span>, in 1878,
and is a magnificent specimen of that eminent maker’s handiwork. In fact, I
am given to understand that Mr. <span class="smcap">Cooper Key</span> considered that he had attained
perfection in this mirror, and of all men then living there was no better judge
than he. The other is 18-1/4 in. in diameter, and was originally figured by
Mr. <span class="smcap">Cooper Key</span> himself; but it was only perfect over the interior 14 in.,
and, consequently, while the whole aperture could be used on the moon and
planets, this was all of it that could be used upon close doubles. I determined,
therefore, to give this mirror to Mr. <span class="smcap">Calver</span> to re-figure, and, if possible, excel
Mr. <span class="smcap">With’s</span> speculum.</p>

<p>“In order that Mr. <span class="smcap">Calver</span> might know the extent of his task, I returned
home through London and Chelmsford, bringing with me both mirrors, which
Mr. <span class="smcap">Calver</span> tested for himself at the centre of curvature. After the trial was
over, he pronounced Mr. <span class="smcap">With’s</span> mirror to be an exceptionally fine one, and
heartily congratulated me on the possession of such a beauty. I left the other
one with him to be re-figured.</p>

<p>“And now to come to the most important part of all&mdash;the performance of the
18 in. <span class="smcap">With</span> mirror upon close double stars. Since the telescope came into my
possession, I have never had a thoroughly good night; but even on an indifferent
one, I have, with the <i>full aperture</i>, divided such extremely difficult
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Appendix_23" id="Appendix_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>tests as η Coronæ, μ<sup>2</sup> Herculis, and δ Cygni; and these results were quite
sufficient to show me that the very high reputation of its excellent maker is
worthily and proudly maintained by this mirror. In fact, the definition it gave
one night, when the Scottish Astronomer Royal was staying with me of ε Boötis,
was such, that the Professor told me I could not expect any telescope, reflector,
or refractor, upon the same object, and on the same night, to do better. However,
I knew Mr. <span class="smcap">Calver</span> was doing his very utmost in the honourable and
praiseworthy competition to attain perfection, to give me a mirror which would
bear favourable comparison with Mr. <span class="smcap">With</span>’s. It reached me about a week
ago, and on the same evening I had an opportunity of testing it upon what I
consider to be one of the very severest tests that can be applied to any telescope,
reflector or refractor, in the northern heavens, that is δ Cygni<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>. To make the
test as severe as possible, I applied the <i>whole</i> aperture at once, with a power of
347. I was surprised and delighted <i>beyond measure</i> with the result. The
small star stood out clearly separated from its bright primary, and there were
two or three diffraction rings round the latter <i>unbroken</i> in any part, and <i>equally</i>
bright all round. I consider the results which Mr. <span class="smcap">Calver</span> has attained in
this mirror cannot possibly be excelled. I measured this star on two separate
nights, and the mean results are pos. 328·9°, dist. 1·29″. I also measured, with
this mirror, another difficult star of the same character, namely, with a bright
primary and small companion, ζ Herculis, with the following results, pos.
111·3°, dist. 1·03″. I make the companion of this star a dusky blue, or lavender.
As regards the light-grasping power of the mirror, I turned it, the other night,
on the minute pair between β<sup>1</sup> and β<sup>2</sup> Capricorni, which Sir John Herschel gave
as the test of the power of any telescope and eye to observe the satellites of
Uranus. The night was very unsteady, but the minute stars of the pair were
most conspicuous.”</p>

tests as regards the distance of the components. He has often seen it with his

but he was surprised at the beauty and perfection of the images&mdash;perfect
and unbroken rings&mdash;and he knew that these appearances could not have presented

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;It is a long time ago that you asked me to write and let you
know how I liked the 9-1/2 in. I have not done so because I wished first to see
what was to be made of the planets.</p>

<p>Last night, at 14<sup>h</sup> 30<sup>m</sup>, I had my first peep at Jupiter through it, and a grand
sight it was; his belts coloured, though not so vivid as they are sometimes,
were fine in the extreme; and, though the power employed was only the
achromatic 215, the satellites were beautiful little discs, one especially showing
the tint of its surface.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Appendix_25" id="Appendix_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
A quarter of an hour later Saturn was in the field of view; a grand object,
several of the satellites surrounding it. A little cloud was coming up over it,
so I could not see so much of this planet as I should have liked, though amply
sufficient to prove incontestably its high class.</p>

<p>With double stars I have not attempted much, though on turning it on μ<sup>2</sup>
Boötis I found the division easy, the components being respectively slightly
orange, and dullish white or pale yellow.</p>

<p>I have had lots of grand views of the wonders of the “star depths,” clusters,
and nebulæ, notably 57 Messier, the Ring nebula, in Lyra, the great Orion
nebula, and the marvellous Whirlpool nebula, the chief outlines of which were
well shown.</p>

<p>Hitherto the instrument has been chiefly employed on the Moon, the details
of which come out hard and sharp in a beautiful manner, with all powers up to
515, the highest I have.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;There has been but little weather for testing. Mr. Slack has
been staying with me; we are delighted with the 8-1/2″, and think it a great
beauty. I can hardly imagine any mirror much better, and I expect great
precision from it. I find its focus to be 65 inches, not quite so much as my
fine Dollond glass, of 3-3/4 in. aperture.</p>

telescope nearly a month ago, but thought I would have another look first,
and the more I look the more I am pleased with it. I cannot now imagine
anyone preferring a 3-1/4 in. refractor to one of these. I have had no trouble at
all with the adjustments, and if was to get out of adjustment, it could be
rectified in about five minutes. Notwithstanding the unsettled weather
(giving on an average only about one fine night in eight), I have examined
nearly two hundred double stars in the last three months, some of them very
difficult. I enclose a list of a few, which will show very well the capabilities
of the instrument.</p>

and the 12″. I have purposely delayed writing until I was <i>really</i> in a position
to say something definite, and you had already heard my high opinion of the
mirror. Let me at once say that that opinion has been <i>more</i> than justified.
The mirror is a <i>beauty</i>. Canon Beechey and I got Jupiter and Saturn at 2.30
a.m. yesterday morning&mdash;and they were <i>superb</i>. The Canon declared enthusiastically,
that he “had <i>never</i> seen Saturn anything like that,” and the
last thing he said to me on the subject as I parted with him to-day was, “You
have got a very fine instrument indeed.”</p>

<p>If I <i>could</i> add anything more in its praise it would be this, that I am really
going to build a <i>new observatory</i> for it&mdash;my present one is too small and
cramped.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear</span> Mr. <span class="smcap">Calver</span>,&mdash;The 12 inch surpasses all my expectations. It has
the perfection in figure of the incomparable 10 inch of yours, which was its
immediate predecessor, and, in grasp of light, the difference in favour of the
12 inch over the 10 inch, a most brilliant mirror, is simply astounding.</p>

<p>You may equal the 12 inch&mdash;I am sure you will, whenever you make one&mdash;but
you will not easily beat it. Mr. <span class="smcap">Sadler</span>, the well-known and most accurate
observer, has himself worked with it, and writes of it to me as follows:&mdash;“The
12 in. is considerably superior in light grasping power to H<sub>2</sub>’s 20 ft. reflector,
and the figure is a much finer one.”</p>

<p>Your skill and kindness has placed me in the front rank among amateur
observers, as far as the possession of optical means is concerned.</p>

<p>I was afraid that the German Stand would not prove so convenient as the
“Berthon Equestrian Stand,” but I find it is and far more so. The German<span class="pagenum"><a name="Appendix_28" id="Appendix_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
Stand is, for anything above 6 in., decidedly more solid and dependable, and
far simpler in any case. The merit of the “Berthon Equestrian” form is
that it requires a smaller observatory.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;As the 11-1/4 in. speculum has now been in constant use for
two years, I may be allowed to express my opinion, with all due deliberation,
as to its performance. It has been tried upon almost every conceivable object
during that period with uniformly good results. Having also a 5 in. achromatic
of the finest quality, I have been enabled to make a great number of comparisons
between the two instruments, mounted side by side: and for fine definition,
smallness of star discs, and freedom from chromatism, the reflector always came
out victorious. Upon first mag. stars, nothing could surpass the purity of the
image in the reflector; but on immediately turning to the achromatic, the
outstanding violet rays were painfully obtrusive. For red stars, which are
generally small, the reflector seems especially adapted. I used to be rather
sceptical about the tints of red stars, but must confess, after seeing the magnificent
tints of scarlet and crimson which are shown by a large aperture, that my
doubts have vanished. Definition upon the planets, in good air, is simply perfect.
The detail on Jupiter and Saturn reminds one of an exquisite engraving. The
far distant Neptune is perfectly defined as a tiny disc, and his moon steadily
visible with the 11-1/4 in. The faculæ and other Solar detail are brought out with
wonderful distinctness. As for the Moon, the crispness of definition, absence of
colour, and immense number of minute objects shown by the reflector, leave
nothing to be desired. The gorgeous views of clusters and nebulæ: the brilliantly
crowded fields in the galaxy: and the endless variety of star colours and groups
are almost beyond description, and must be seen to be appreciated. I could fill
pages about objects seen with the 11-1/4 in. mirror, but will not occupy more
space, save to thank you for having placed such perfect instruments within the
reach of amateurs.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;Mr. <span class="smcap">Burnham</span> is undoubtedly “facile princeps,” as an
observer of double stars. Few men could have discovered such difficult objects
as he has done with a 6″ O.G. Perhaps, it ought to be conceded that the usual
formula for separating power, requires modification in his case, as Pogson’s
formula for “minima visible” did with Mr. <span class="smcap">J. W. Ward</span>, of Belfast. Apropos
of this topic: do you recollect Mr. <span class="smcap">Ward’s</span> discovery of several additional comites
to Pxx 452 Cygni? One of them Mr. <span class="smcap">Burnham</span> only succeeded in seeing with
the greatest difficulty with the 6″ O.G. when the large star was hidden by a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Appendix_29" id="Appendix_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
bar. I can see this easily enough with the 11-1/4 in. mirror, in presence
of the brighter star.</p>

<p>When you have any intending customers halting between two opinions, or

<p><span class="smcap">My Dear</span> Mr. <span class="smcap">Calver</span>,&mdash;The 12 inch mirror which you worked and
mounted for me gives me perfect satisfaction. I think I have had sufficient
experience with telescopes to justify the expression of a confident opinion, as at
one time or other I think I have had 13 achromatic telescopes by Tulley,
Dollond, Simms, Jones, Cooke, and Murrell, of apertures varying from 2-1/4 to 7
inches, besides 5 graduated instruments. The one I had before yours was an 8-1/8
With-Browning, which With himself considered of as fine a figure as he could
work, and it certainly was a beautiful mirror. Your 12 inch is quite as perfect
in its definition. I have soon on particularly fine evenings Castor as two discs,
without wing or ray. I have separated with ease ω Leonis, μ<sup>2</sup> Boötis, η
Coronæ, γ<sup>2</sup> Andromedæ, and many others of that class. The planets Jupiter
and Saturn on fine nights are magnificent. I could go into more detail, but I
think the facts I have mentioned are sufficient to convey an idea of the performance
of the mirror; and I am particular in expressing my opinion thus
strongly, because great names, with no experience of reflectors, are committed
to their condemnation. I am certain that under favourable circumstances they
are <i>quite</i> equal in their performances to refractors. I know my 8-1/8 With
was in every way equal to my 7 inch Troughton and Simms, and in light
superior, when newly silvered. And when the cost is taken into consideration,
Cooke’s price of a 10 inch O.G. being £390, without mounting,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Appendix_30" id="Appendix_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
and your price for a 10 inch mirror being only £25, I can only express my
astonishment that there can exist any doubt in the scientific mind upon the
subject.</p>

<p>May I say that I shall be pleased to answer any questions that any of your
intending purchasers may wish to ask. I cannot speak too highly of your
mirror. I may add that through the courtesy of its possessor, <span class="smcap">A. A. Common</span>,

him.</p>

of great excellence would bear that power, and give you two <i>dots</i>! I would
not part with it for anything. When I have been to Mr. Bruce he is coming to
me, and we will try your 12″ against my 10″. He will have light, a great

Two brilliant dots. Colour of companion, pale lilac. Full aperture. Power
207, Cooke. 6 p.m.</p>

<p><i>August 30th.</i>&mdash;Dumb bell nebula. Well seen. Not at all regular in outline,
as given by H. Several glimpse stars.</p>

<p><i>September 24th.</i>&mdash;ζ Herculis. Very fine definition. The difficulty with
this star is clearly atmospheric. I saw it well with 8 in. aperture, power 207:
but the interference ring became thicker and continuous all round: probably
owing to the larger size of my diagonal prism, nearly 2-1/2 in.</p>

<p>The planets are now again simply magnificent. All the usual details I see
splendidly with full aperture of 12 in., and as sharp as if cut out with a penknife.
The great red spot is a wonderful phenomenon. What is it?</p>

<p>The great nebula in Andromeda, seen through your fine nebula power is a
mysterious sight. You seem to be looking at something which eludes your
vision (except the nucleus); you see it, and yet, ghost-like, you see through it.
I long for the great nebula in Orion. I did not see it last year on account

of the large spot, at present visible on his southern hemisphere, were strikingly
conspicuous, as were many minute details of his surface. In the case of Saturn,
the gradations of light on the rings, and the delicately tinted belts on the planet
itself, also the sharply defined shadow of the planet on the rings were easily seen.</p>

<p>Its definition of the most minute portions of the moon’s surface, leaves
nothing to be desired, whilst its performance on double stars is equally
satisfactory.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;Your figuring of the 8-1/2 in. mirror has given me much satisfaction.
I see ε<sup>1</sup> ε<sup>2</sup> Lyræ, and such stars, with 600, very sharp and clear.</p>

<p>I have counted six satellites of Saturn, and the equatorial belt is very distinct.</p>

<p>Last week I happened to observe Jupiter, when a black shadow of a satellite
was beautifully notching the limb, at the same time a small pearl-like satellite
was about to egress from the belts. I saw, also, six spherical cloudlets on
the belts.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear</span> Mr. <span class="smcap">Calver</span>,&mdash;To-night was an exceptional fine night for the stars, the
like of which I have not had since I got your 6-1/2 in. I had for a week or so
been observing with my home-made 8 in., but to-night again recurred to <i>yours</i>,
and its <i>superiority</i> was all the more <i>conspicuous</i> and <i>gratifying</i>. It quite
<i>delighted me afresh</i>!</p>

<p>Looking at β Cygni, I picked up two, to me, new stars, which I think fully
completes Mr. <span class="smcap">Sadler’s</span> tests in this field. I mark the newly found ones in
red. This only shows that one has only patiently to watch and wait for a
suitable observing night to get one out of a certain aperture it is capable
of showing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;I can scarcely express to you the pleasure I have had in the
use of your splendid 6-1/2 in. mirror. Both in light grasping power, and in the
separation of close double stars, it has far surpassed my highest expectations,
and quite removed the prejudice I entertained against reflectors. Though
possessing a first-class 4-1/4 in. refractor, equatorially mounted in my observatory,
I now use your mirror in preference, in the more difficult and delicate
observations, and with it am able to master the most severe tests given for 6-1/2
in. aperture. I would not be without one of your finely figured mirrors, now
that I have tested their merits, for any consideration.</p>

with 6-1/2 in. was highly gratifying. I hope to turn it to very good account.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
